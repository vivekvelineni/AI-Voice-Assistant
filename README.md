# AI-Voice-Assistant

This is an AI voice assistant that can understand and respond to voice commands in a natural and human-like manner. The voice assistant utilizes three main technologies: OpenAI's Whisper Speech-to-Text model, GPT-3's textdavinci-003 API, and pyttsx3's Text-to-Speech technology. 

The Whisper model is an open-source Speech-to-Text model that functions similarly to a human ear, transcribing voice input into text. The transcribed text is then sent to GPT-3's text-davinci-003 API, which generates a response based on the prompt received. 

This response is then converted to human-like speech using pyttsx3's Text-to-Speech technology. In this way, Whisper acts as the "ear" of the voice assistant, GPT-3 acts as the "brain," and pyttsx3 acts as the "mouth" producing speech. 

This integration allows for more natural and human-like interaction with the voice assistant. The end result is an AI voice assistant that can understand and respond to voice commands in a natural and human-like manner.
